# Week 4 Assignment

## What went well

- The HTML for works and submits data into the database
- It then displays the data in the text box
- My design works on multiple screen sizes thanks to media querys
- my get api and post api works
- my table has data in it already
- the like button updates the likes on client side and changes the heart red, but doesnt update the database

## What went not so well

- Im not sure how to update specific likes in the database, or just update them all together
- similarly I wasnt sure how to get a delete button to work where it delete the specific comment it as on
